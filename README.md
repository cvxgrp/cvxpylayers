# cvxpylayers

cvxpylayers is a Python library for constructing differentiable convex
optimization layers in PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow using CVXPY.
A convex optimization layer solves a parametrized convex optimization problem
in the forward pass to produce a solution.
It computes the derivative of the solution with respect to
the parameters in the backward pass.

This library accompanies our [NeurIPS 2019 paper](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/diff_cvxpy.pdf)
on differentiable convex optimization layers.
For an informal introduction to convex optimization layers, see our
[blog post](https://locuslab.github.io/2019-10-28-cvxpylayers/).

Our package uses [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy) for specifying
parametrized convex optimization problems.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install
cvxpylayers.

```bash
pip install cvxpylayers
```

Our package includes convex optimization layers for
PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow 2.0;
the layers are functionally equivalent. You will need to install
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org),
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), or
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
separately, which can be done by following the instructions on their websites.

cvxpylayers has the following dependencies:
* Python 3
* [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
* [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy) >= 1.1.a4
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) >= 1.0, [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) >= 0.2.12, or [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) >= 2.0
* [diffcp](https://github.com/cvxgrp/diffcp) >= 1.0.13

## Usage
Below are usage examples of our PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow layers.
Note that the parametrized convex optimization problems must be constructed
in CVXPY, using
[DPP](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#disciplined-parametrized-programming).

### PyTorch

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import torch
from cvxpylayers.torch import CvxpyLayer

n, m = 2, 3
x = cp.Variable(n)
A = cp.Parameter((m, n))
b = cp.Parameter(m)
constraints = [x >= 0]
objective = cp.Minimize(0.5 * cp.pnorm(A @ x - b, p=1))
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
assert problem.is_dpp()

cvxpylayer = CvxpyLayer(problem, parameters=[A, b], variables=[x])
A_tch = torch.randn(m, n, requires_grad=True)
b_tch = torch.randn(m, requires_grad=True)

# solve the problem
solution, = cvxpylayer(A_tch, b_tch)

# compute the gradient of the sum of the solution with respect to A, b
solution.sum().backward()
```

Note: `CvxpyLayer` cannot be traced with `torch.jit`.

### JAX
```python
import cvxpy as cp
import jax
from cvxpylayers.jax import CvxpyLayer

n, m = 2, 3
x = cp.Variable(n)
A = cp.Parameter((m, n))
b = cp.Parameter(m)
constraints = [x >= 0]
objective = cp.Minimize(0.5 * cp.pnorm(A @ x - b, p=1))
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
assert problem.is_dpp()

cvxpylayer = CvxpyLayer(problem, parameters=[A, b], variables=[x])
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
key, k1, k2 = jax.random.split(key, 3)
A_jax = jax.random.normal(k1, shape=(m, n))
b_jax = jax.random.normal(k2, shape=(m,))

solution, = cvxpylayer(A_jax, b_jax)

# compute the gradient of the summed solution with respect to A, b
dcvxpylayer = jax.grad(lambda A, b: sum(cvxpylayer(A, b)[0]), argnums=[0, 1])
gradA, gradb = dcvxpylayer(A_jax, b_jax)
```

Note: `CvxpyLayer` cannot be traced with the JAX `jit` or `vmap` operations.

### TensorFlow 2
```python
import cvxpy as cp
import tensorflow as tf
from cvxpylayers.tensorflow import CvxpyLayer

n, m = 2, 3
x = cp.Variable(n)
A = cp.Parameter((m, n))
b = cp.Parameter(m)
constraints = [x >= 0]
objective = cp.Minimize(0.5 * cp.pnorm(A @ x - b, p=1))
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
assert problem.is_dpp()

cvxpylayer = CvxpyLayer(problem, parameters=[A, b], variables=[x])
A_tf = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((m, n)))
b_tf = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((m,)))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  # solve the problem, setting the values of A, b to A_tf, b_tf
  solution, = cvxpylayer(A_tf, b_tf)
  summed_solution = tf.math.reduce_sum(solution)
# compute the gradient of the summed solution with respect to A, b
gradA, gradb = tape.gradient(summed_solution, [A_tf, b_tf])
```

Note: `CvxpyLayer` cannot be traced with `tf.function`.

### Log-log convex programs
Starting with version 0.1.3, cvxpylayers can also differentiate through log-log convex programs (LLCPs), which generalize geometric programs. Use the keyword argument `gp=True` when constructing a `CvxpyLayer` for an LLCP. Below is a simple usage example

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import torch
from cvxpylayers.torch import CvxpyLayer

x = cp.Variable(pos=True)
y = cp.Variable(pos=True)
z = cp.Variable(pos=True)

a = cp.Parameter(pos=True, value=2.)
b = cp.Parameter(pos=True, value=1.)
c = cp.Parameter(value=0.5)

objective_fn = 1/(x*y*z)
objective = cp.Minimize(objective_fn)
constraints = [a*(x*y + x*z + y*z) <= b, x >= y**c]
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
assert problem.is_dgp(dpp=True)

layer = CvxpyLayer(problem, parameters=[a, b, c],
                   variables=[x, y, z], gp=True)
a_tch = torch.tensor(a.value, requires_grad=True)
b_tch = torch.tensor(b.value, requires_grad=True)
c_tch = torch.tensor(c.value, requires_grad=True)

x_star, y_star, z_star = layer(a_tch, b_tch, c_tch)
sum_of_solution = x_star + y_star + z_star
sum_of_solution.backward()
```

## Solvers

At this time, we support two open-source solvers: [SCS](https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs) and [ECOS](https://github.com/embotech/ecos).
SCS can be used to solve any problem expressible in CVXPY; ECOS can be used to solve problems that don't use
the positive semidefinite or exponential cone (this roughly means that if you have positive semidefinite matrices
or use atoms like `cp.log`, ECOS cannot be used to solve your problem via `cvxpylayers`).
By default, `cvxpylayers` uses SCS to solve the problem.

### Using ECOS
First make sure that you have `cvxpylayers` and `diffcp` up to date,
by running
```
pip install --upgrade cvxpylayers diffcp
```
Then, to use ECOS, you would pass the `solver_args` argument to the layer:
```
solution = layer(*params, solver_args={"solve_method": "ECOS"})
```

### Passing arguments to the solvers
One can pass arguments to both SCS and ECOS by adding the argument as a key-value pair
in the `solver_args` argument.
For example, to increase the tolerance of SCS to `1e-8` one would write:
```
layer(*parameters, solver_args={"eps": 1e-8})
```
If SCS is not converging, we highly recommend switching to ECOS (if possible),
and if not, using the following arguments to `SCS`:
```
solver_args={"eps": 1e-8, "max_iters": 10000, "acceleration_lookback": 0}
```
