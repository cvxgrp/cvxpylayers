# cvxpylayers

cvxpylayers is a Python library for constructing differentiable convex
optimization layers in PyTorch and TensorFlow using CVXPY.
A convex optimization layer solves a parametrized convex optimization problem
in the forward pass to produce a solution.
It computes the derivative of the solution with respect to
the parameters in the backward pass.

This library accompanies our [NeurIPS 2019 paper](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/diff_cvxpy.pdf)
on differentiable convex optimization layers.
For an informal introduction to convex optimization layers, see our
[blog post](https://locuslab.github.io/2019-10-28-cvxpylayers/).

Our package uses [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy) for specifying
parametrized convex optimization problems.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install
cvxpylayers.

```bash
pip install cvxpylayers
```

Our package includes convex optimization layers for PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0;
the layers are functionally equivalent. You will need to install
[PyTorch](http://pytorch.org) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
separately, which can be done by following the instructions on their websites.

cvxpylayers has the following dependencies:
* Python 3
* [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
* [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy) >= 1.1.a1
* [TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org) >= 2.0 or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) >= 1.0
* [diffcp](https://github.com/cvxgrp/diffcp) >= 1.0.14

## Usage
Below are usage examples of our PyTorch and TensorFlow layers. Note that
the parametrized convex optimization problems must be constructed in CVXPY,
using [DPP](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#disciplined-parametrized-programming).

### PyTorch

```python
import cvxpy as cp
import torch 
from cvxpylayers.torch import CvxpyLayer

n, m = 2, 3
x = cp.Variable(n)
A = cp.Parameter((m, n))
b = cp.Parameter(m)
constraints = [x >= 0]
objective = cp.Minimize(0.5 * cp.pnorm(A @ x - b, p=1))
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
assert problem.is_dpp()

cvxpylayer = CvxpyLayer(problem, parameters=[A, b], variables=[x])
A_tch = torch.randn(m, n, requires_grad=True)
b_tch = torch.randn(m, requires_grad=True)

# solve the problem
solution, = cvxpylayer(A_tch, b_tch)

# compute the gradient of the sum of the solution with respect to A, b
solution.sum().backward()
```

### TensorFlow 2
```python
import cvxpy as cp
import tensorflow as tf
from cvxpylayers.tensorflow import CvxpyLayer

n, m = 2, 3
x = cp.Variable(n)
A = cp.Parameter((m, n))
b = cp.Parameter(m)
constraints = [x >= 0]
objective = cp.Minimize(0.5 * cp.pnorm(A @ x - b, p=1))
problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
assert problem.is_dpp()

cvxpylayer = CvxpyLayer(problem, parameters=[A, b], variables=[x])
A_tf = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((m, n)))
b_tf = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal((m,)))

with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
  # solve the problem, setting the values of A, b to A_tf, b_tf
  solution, = cvxpylayer(A_tf, b_tf)
  summed_solution = tf.math.reduce_sum(solution)
# compute the gradient of the summed solution with respect to A, b
gradA, gradb = tape.gradient(summed_solution, [A_tf, b_tf])
```

layers in IPython notebooks.
